# Keycloak Laravel Implementation
This Keycloak lib does not load users from database.
Keycloak user UUIDs are usually stored in the sub claim.

## Installation
```bash
composer require wg-hyve/keycloak-laravel-guard
```

## Configuration
Add your keycloak to your guards and use it in your routes as middleware. That's it for a normal usage.
### config/auth.php
```php
return [
    'guards' => [
        // ...
        'cloak' => [
            'driver' => 'keycloak',
            'provider' => 'users',
        ],
        // ...
    ],
];
```

### routes/api.php
```php
Route::any('/acme', [AcmeController::class, 'index'])->middleware(['auth:cloak']);
```

## Extended usage
The KeycloakGuard comes with some methods to keep it easy.

### Example usage in requests
```php

namespace App\Http\Requests;

use Illuminate\Foundation\Http\FormRequest;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;

class DeleteRequest extends FormRequest
{
    public function authorize(): bool
    {
        return Auth::hasScope('can-delete');
    }

    public function rules(): array
    {
        return [];
    }
}
```

### Other Methods

#### getTokenFromRequest
Get raw Token from request
#### token(): ?stdClass
Get encoded Token from request
#### hasRole(array|string $roles): bool
Proofs if the role or one of the roles is in your client or global roles
#### scopes(): array
Delivers all scopes
#### hasScope(string|array $scope): bool
Proofs if the scope or one of the scopes is in your JWT
#### getRoles(): array
Delivers all roles from your client. Client is delivered in azp claim.
#### roles(bool $useGlobal = true): array
